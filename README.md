notes: 

weird link behavior in openshot markdown, might work in actual build

consider adding alert to mazegen 

add headers for diff posts and all pages

make welcome splash page when click on me
also make it first page of website

change authenticator so no one can make an acct

different export methods 

"const functionName = ({ param }) => (
    how does this work with parenthesis instead of {} as function wrapper????
);

pgbouncer???
