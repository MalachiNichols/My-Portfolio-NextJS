# README
Welcome, 

This is the repository for my portfolio website. The application was originally prototyped in react, but I migrated the project to nextjs. The backend for this project includes a postgresql database that I connected to the server through prisma. I opted to use, almost exclusively, external CSS styling, so that I could practice and get more comfortable with CSS. The website is hosted through Vercel.

Overall, the website includes:
* An about me page to give a brief introduction of my experience and interests
* A markdown blog with some technical writing examples that I created
* A maze generator and solver application with instructions
* A list of some of my favorite drummers with embedded videos 

Please feel free to check out the website [here](https://my-portfolio-next-js-seven.vercel.app/).

You can contact me with any questions at malachizachary@gmail.com

Thanks for visiting!
